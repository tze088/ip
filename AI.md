ðŸ¤– How AI Helped

To create this user guide, I used AI assistance (ChatGPT) to help translate the functionality of my Bongo task manager into clear, structured documentation in Markdown format. I provided the source code, and the AI analyzed the logic, commands, and behavior of the application.

Specifically, the AI helped with:

* Understanding command behavior from code structure

* Drafting user-friendly descriptions and examples of each feature

* Formatting commands in a readable, consistent way

* Maintaining the appâ€™s personality

* Ensuring completeness by including all available commands and examples

This made the process significantly faster and more efficient, while still allowing me to review and adapt the content to fit my voice and project goals.
